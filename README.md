## 💡 Inspiration
- Most people associate learning with boredom, we propose this game - The Kunal Run, which combined learning with fun. this will help players to refresh     their minds as well as learn new things about different fields of computer science and development.

## ⚙️ What it does
- Learning about tech through watching youtube videos and tech news is boring why not learn while 
  gaming? We created a game in which you can learn about tech while playing. This is a 2D runner game 
  in which you will have to collect skills and Kunal will tell answers to questions asked by enemies which 
  will deplete your skills/coins.
- Other than that with learning skills, you can also implement them using contributing to specific open- 
  source projects. So here we are providing you with a curated list of Open source projects as per your 
  skill set.
- Also, we are providing you a list of opportunities for which you can apply for earning money from your 
  skills like MLH Fellowship and Google Summer of Code.

## 🛠️ How we built it
- For Frontend and Graphics we use Canva, Figma, and other designing tools.
- We built this game using the Unity Game Engine, C#, and Stream API. It is our  First time working with the Unity game engine as well as C# and it was     worth it to try it out, even though it wasn't easy to use it. but we were all really interested in learning - so this weekend, we committed to it!

## ⚠️ Challenges we ran into
- As It was also difficult to find the right assets for our game. So we design it all by ourselves, it was the first time we work on designing 2-D artists   and other things like Landing pages, etc. Since being a Coder, it is difficult but still, we will be able to do it.

- It is our first time working with Unity Game Engine and C#, so it was a pretty steep learning curve. It was difficult to make the background of our game   animated, we also find difficulty in removing the enemy whenever sound power collided with them.

## 👩‍💼🧑‍💻 Accomplishments that we're proud of

## 🧑‍💻 What we learned
- We learned that it can be frustrating at times to try to learn an entirely new language and software as a team. But it was also, really, really fun, the most important things are to remember we're all in this together, and to never give up. Some bugs take a lot of time to fix but we just gotta try and try until we succeed. we gotta put in our 100%, at the end of the day it doesn't matter if we lose or win, what matter is did we give our best.

## 👩‍💼 What's next for Kunal Run 
I'm truly glad about the partnership between Hashnode and WeMakeDevs that made this awesome Hackathon! Thanks for your awesome services and support. 🌹
